# Pipeline_Method_Model

A machine learning pipeline is used to help automate machine learning workflows. They operate by enabling a sequence of data to be transformed and correlated together in a model that can be tested and evaluated to achieve an outcome, whether positive or negative.

Machine learning (ML) pipelines consist of several steps to train a model. Machine learning pipelines are iterative as every step is repeated to continuously improve the accuracy of the model and achieve a successful algorithm. To build better machine learning models, and get the most value from them, accessible, scalable and durable storage solutions are imperative, paving the way for on-premises object storage.
